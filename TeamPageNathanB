  <p>The Honey bee probablying being a few weeks or little months old is a diligent worker as 
   it keeps away tiny nats away from the plant as an whole.</p>

    <p>Little bro is a small sproutling of a red pepper.And the big bro is a bigger one 
        having sprout a few days before the other one making that much of a height difference.</p>

  <p>In these two are taken care of by me and the bee
   as I water it and the bee protect it by doing whhatever it wants around the pot.</p><hr/>

      <p>Started to grow a few seedling and these sprouted first so I decided to plant them little did I know it would attract that bee the bee doesn't sting me when I'm around.</p>

      <p>To watch them grow and learn and practice about their grow and regret how late I planted them and hope they grow bigger before the winter to survive .</p><hr/>
